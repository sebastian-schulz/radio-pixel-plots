ABOUT THE PROGRAMM
This is a collection of python scripts in order to analyze radio maps (i.e. from LOFAR) and calculate star formation rates using the condon relation. You will always need two different radio maps with different frequencies, but same size and resolution. You also need a star formation map (again same size and resolution).

The script then uses the two radio maps to calculate the spectral index 'alpha' in order to cut out thermal radio emmissions. The radio maps are then changed to a pixel size of 1200pc and (after converting to SFR via condon) plotted vs the corresponding pixels from the SFR map.

In a second step uses a gaussian filter to smear out the sfr map. This models  simple diffusion of the electrons in the galaxy. The width of the filter 'sigma' is fitted to reach best possible agreement with the condon relation. The sigma is directly proportional to the diffusion length.

HOW IT WORKS
The main program is called 'rpp-pixelplots.py'. It needs the radio maps to be in the same directory. You also need to update the config file to your paths and fill in data of the galaxy you want to analyze. A default file for NGC XXXX is provided in the radio-pixel-plots folder (called nXXXX.ini).

usage then is $: python3 pixelplots.py <path to config file>

rpp-compare.py is a standalone script that will write all the resulting data (if you ran pixelplots.py for many different galaxies) into one tab separated file for further analysis. 

FURTHER READING
A more in depth documentation will be provided in the future. Also check the code for documentation on how exactly it works.
